# Initializing Exploits Tree

Shennina implements a thorough approach to choosing reliable remote exploits from the Metasploit Framework. The technique used here and in other functionalities in Shennina eliminates false positives as well as ensures that all exploits within the Shennina Framework can be utilized in automated remote exploitation.

Initializing the exploits tree will run automatically on the first run of Shennina.


To manually initialize the exploits tree, run:

```bash

$ ./shennina.py --initialize-exploits-tree
  ____  _                      _
 / ___|| |__   ___ _ __  _ __ (_)_ __   __ _
 \___ \| '_ \ / _ \ '_ \| '_ \| | '_ \ / _` |
  ___) | | | |  __/ | | | | | | | | | | (_| |
 |____/|_| |_|\___|_| |_|_| |_|_|_| |_|\__,_|

It's recommended to re-initialize on a monthly basis so that newly added exploits to the Metasploit Framework will be validated and added to Shennina exploits tree.
