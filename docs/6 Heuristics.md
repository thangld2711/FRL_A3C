## Introduction

As discussed in Chapter 5, implementing a deep learning model without enough data can cause the network to output strange behavior; in which we had to rectify via post-processing functions.

In this following section, we will discuss the impact of simplifying this issue by using a heuristics model as a secondary option to support the system.


## The Approach

This model utilizes a pre-defined list of "known to be effective" exploits against specific products. The training phase for this model occurs by scoring approach whenever the framework observes the exploit in a dataset, its score is incremented.

The testing phase works by matching observed exploits with what has been observed in the training phase against a certain product or service.


Please note that this used a secondary option to support the system for the major model.
