# What We Added to DeepExploit



## Improvement on the AI model.

Please check the AI section for more details.

## Significant Increase in Training Speed

We have rewritten the training codebase in a way that improved speed by 6x times.


## Post Exploitation Capabilities

We have significantly increased the post-exploitation capabilities of DeepExploit. You can read the number of features Shennina has created.


## Data Exfiltration

We have implemented data exfiltration capabilities to Shennina.


## Automated Suggestion for Potential local root exploits

We have added a capability to Shennina to be able to suggest potential local root exploits.


## Custom Agents Development

We have added an environment for building and automating post-exploitation payloads.


## Improving Exploits Clustering

We have improved exploiting clustering to provide more relevant exploits for training and scanning purposes.


## Attack Simulation Features: Ransomware simulation

Ransomware simulation at Shennina is a custom capability for running ransomware simulation against compromised targets. Once a target is compromised, Shennina can obfuscate the home directory of the user automatically via a custom agent designed for Shennina.


## Attack Simulation Feature: Deception Detection

Deception Detection at Shennina is functionality for performing deception detection during the exploitation phase for both *nix and Windows environments. Once a host is identified to be potentially designed for deception, the attack will be terminated without exposing custom code and malware to the target for anti-deception purposes.


## Out-of-Band Capabilities for Confirming Exploitation

Shennina added an additional capability to confirm the exploitation of targets via OOB (Out-of-Band) techniques.


## Secondary exploitation mode via Heuristics

Shennina implemented a secondary mode for exploitation via Heuristics.

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework concepts.

Shennina applies TTPs from the MITRE ATT&CK framework in order to perform successful attack simulations.
