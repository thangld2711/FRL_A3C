# Exploitation Mode

The exploitation mode in Shennina is the most important part of the framework. Shennina gathers the data for the target, utilize it by processing it, and then feeds it to the AI engine, which determines the best exploit to use against the target.

Once the best exploit is determined, the exploit runs against the machine. If the exploit is confirmed against the target, the automated post-exploitation and exfiltration phase starts.


## Run Shennina in Exploitation Mode

```bash
$ ./shennina.py --lhost lhost.local --target target.local --exploitation-mode
```

## Use secondary learning option on Shennina (Heuristics)

This option uses a heuristics approach for suggesting recommended exploits against services and products running on the target.

```bash
$ ./shennina.py --lhost lhost.local --target target.local --exploitation-mode --secondary-mode
```
