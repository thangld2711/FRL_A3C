The vulnerability is within the \"sreplace\" function within the \"src/support.c\" file. The off-by-one heap overflow bug in the ProFTPD sreplace function has been discovered about 2 (two) years ago by Evgeny Legerov. We tried to exploit this off-by-one bug via MKD command, but failed. We did not work on this bug since then. Actually, there are exists at least two bugs in sreplace function, one is the mentioned off-by-one heap overflow bug the other is a stack-based buffer overflow via 'sstrncpy(dst,src,negative argument)'. We were unable to reach the \"sreplace\" stack bug on ProFTPD 1.2.10 stable version, but the version 1.3.0rc3 introduced some interesting changes, among them: 1. another (integer) overflow in sreplace! 2. now it is possible to reach sreplace stack-based buffer overflow bug via the \"pr_display_file\" function! 3. stupid '.message' file display bug So we decided to choose ProFTPD 1.3.0 as a target for our exploit. To reach the bug, you need to upload a specially created .message file to a writeable directory, then do \"CWD <writeable directory>\" to trigger the invocation of sreplace function. Note that ProFTPD 1.3.0rc3 has introduced a stupid bug: to display '.message' file you also have to upload a file named '250'. ProFTPD 1.3.0 fixes this bug. The exploit is a part of VulnDisco Pack since Dec 2005.",

By sending data containing a large number of Telnet IAC commands, an attacker can corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code. The Debian Squeeze version of the exploit uses a little ROP stub to indirectly transfer the flow of execution to a pool buffer (the cmd_rec \"res\" in \"pr_cmd_read\"). The Ubuntu version uses a ROP stager to mmap RWX memory, copy a small stub to it, and execute the stub. The stub then copies the remainder of the payload in and executes it. NOTE: Most Linux distributions either do not ship a vulnerable version of ProFTPD, or they ship a version compiled with stack smashing protection. Although SSP significantly reduces the probability of a single attempt succeeding, it will not prevent exploitation. Since the daemon forks in a default configuration, the cookie value will remain the same despite some attempts failing. By making repeated requests, an attacker can eventually guess the cookie value and exploit the vulnerability. The cookie in Ubuntu has 24-bits of entropy. This reduces the effectiveness and could allow exploitation in semi-reasonable amount of time.",

This exploit is executed through the ASA's ASDM web server and lands in the FirePower Services SFR module's Linux virtual machine as the root user. Access to the virtual machine allows the attacker to pivot to the inside network, and access the outside network. Also, the SFR virtual machine is running snort on the traffic flowing through the ASA, so the attacker should have access to this diverted traffic as well. This module requires ASDM credentials in order to traverse the ASDM interface. A similar attack can be performed via Cisco CLI (over SSH), although that isn't implemented here. Finally, it's worth noting that this attack bypasses the affects of the `lockdown-sensor` command (e.g. the virtual machine's bash shell shouldn't be available but this attack makes it available). Cisco assigned this issue CVE-2022-20828. The issue affects all Cisco ASA that support the ASA FirePOWER module (at least Cisco ASA-X with FirePOWER Service, and Cisco ISA 3000). The vulnerability has been patched in ASA FirePOWER module versions 6.2.3.19, 6.4.0.15, 6.6.7, and 7.0.21. The following versions will receive no patch: 6.2.2 and earlier, 6.3.*, 6.5.*, and 6.7.*.",

The first one, CVE-2019-1937, is an authentication bypass, that allows the attacker to authenticate as an administrator. The second one, CVE-2019-1936, is a command injection in a password change form, that allows the attacker to inject commands that will execute as root. This module combines both vulnerabilities to achieve the unauthenticated command injection as root. It has been tested with Cisco UCS Director virtual machines 6.6.0 and 6.7.0. Note that Cisco also mentions in their advisory that their IMC Supervisor and UCS Director Express are also affected by these vulnerabilities, but this module was not tested with those products.",

Others might be affected, and this vulnerability is present in both MIPS and ARM devices. The MIPS devices are powered by Lextra RLX processors, which are crippled MIPS cores lacking a few load and store instructions. Because of this the payloads have to be sent unencoded, which can cause them to fail, although the bind shell seems to work well. For the ARM devices, the inline reverse tcp seems to work best.

The vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute commands as root. Exploitation happens in two stages: 1. An SQL injection during username lookup while executing the \"Forgot Password\" function. 2. A command injection that occurs after the user provided username is passed to a Python script via the shell.

The third and final stage occurs when the file executed as \"nobody\" writes an entry into the database that causes QRadar to execute a shell script controlled by the attacker as root within the next minute. Details about these vulnerabilities can be found in the advisories listed in References.

This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `Events` feature of Pandora FMS. This flaw allows users to execute arbitrary commands via the `target` parameter in HTTP POST requests to the `Events` function. After authenticating to the target, the module attempts to exploit this flaw by issuing such an HTTP POST request, with the `target` parameter set to contain the payload. If a shell is obtained, the module will try to obtain the local MySQL database password via a simple `grep` command on the plaintext `/var/www/html/pandora_console/include/config.php` file. Valid credentials for a Pandora FMS account are required. The account does not need to have admin privileges.

The vulnerability can only be exploited by an attacker on the LAN side of the router, but the attacker does not need any authentication to abuse it. After exploitation, an attacker will be able to execute any command as root, including downloading and executing a binary from another host. This vulnerability was discovered and exploited at Pwn2Own Tokyo 2019 by the Flashback team (Pedro Ribeiro + Radek Domanski). This module was updated in November 2020, after a bypass was discovered for the patch TP-Link issued. The new injection technique works on older firmware too. All firmware versions up to (but excluding) releases 201029 and 201030 are exploitable.",

However, the stack buffer that is written to exists within a parent function's stack frame. NOTE: This vulnerability requires a non-default configuration. First, the attacker must be able to pass the host-based authentication. Next, the server must be configured to listen on an accessible network interface. Lastly, the server must have been manually configured to use SSL. The binary from version 5.5.0-m2 was built with /GS and /SafeSEH. During testing on Windows XP SP3, these protections successfully prevented exploitation. Testing was also done with mysql on Ubuntu 9.04. Although the vulnerable code is present, both version 5.5.0-m2 built from source and version 5.0.75 from a binary package were not exploitable due to the use of the compiler's FORTIFY feature. Although suse11 was mentioned in the original blog post, the binary package they provide does not contain yaSSL or support SSL.",

The vulnerability was introduced by Debian and Ubuntu Redis packages that insufficiently sanitized the Lua environment. The maintainers failed to disable the package interface, allowing attackers to load arbitrary libraries. On a typical `redis` deployment (not docker), this module achieves execution as the `redis` user. Debian/Ubuntu packages run Redis using systemd with the \"MemoryDenyWriteExecute\" permission, which limits some of what an attacker can do. For example, staged meterpreter will fail when attempting to use mprotect. As such, stageless meterpreter is the preferred payload. Redis can be configured with authentication or not. This module will work with either configuration (provided you provide the correct authentication details). This vulnerability could theoretically be exploited across a few architectures: i386, arm, ppc, etc. However, the module only supports x86_64, which is likely to be the most popular version.",

When handling chained response packets, Samba fails to validate the offset value used when building the next part. By setting this value to a number larger than the destination buffer size, an attacker can corrupt memory. Additionally, setting this value to a value smaller than 'smb_wct' (0x24) will cause the header of the input buffer chunk to be corrupted. After close inspection, it appears that 3.0.x versions of Samba are not exploitable. Since they use an \"InputBuffer\" size of 0x20441, an attacker cannot cause memory to be corrupted in an exploitable way. It is possible to corrupt the heap header of the \"InputBuffer\", but it didn't seem possible to get the chunk to be processed again prior to process exit. In order to gain code execution, this exploit attempts to overwrite a \"talloc chunk\" destructor function pointer. This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems that do not have the nx memory protection. NOTE: It is possible to make exploitation attempts indefinitely since Samba forks for user sessions in the default configuration.",

The zip archive takes advantage of a directory traversal vulnerability that will cause the PHP file to be dropped in the root server directory (`htdocs` for Windows and `html` for Linux targets). The PHP file contains an encoded payload that allows for remote command execution on the target server. The zip archive can be uploaded via two vectors, the `Import New Language` function and the `Patcher` function. The module first uploads the archive via `Import New Language` and then attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to the PHP file in the root server directory. If no session is obtained, the module creates another zip archive and attempts exploitation via `Patcher`. Valid credentials for an ATutor admin account are required.

The server will rename this file to a random string. The module will therefore attempt to change the filename back to the original name via an HTTP POST request to `/admin/file-manager/rename`. For the `php` target, the payload is embedded in the uploaded file and the module attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to `/storage/file_name`. For the `linux` and `windows` targets, the module uploads a simple PHP web shell similar to `<?php system($_GET[\"cmd\"]); ?>`. Subsequently, it leverages the CmdStager mixin to deliver the final payload via a series of HTTP GET requests to the PHP web shell. Valid credentials for a HorizontCMS user with permissions to use the FileManager are required.

The SQL injection can be used to achieve remote code execution as SYSTEM in Windows or as the user in Linux. This module exploits both PostgreSQL (newer builds) and MySQL (older or upgraded builds). MySQL targets are more reliable due to the use of relative paths; with PostgreSQL you should find the web root path via other means and specify it with WEB_ROOT. The injection is only exploitable via a GET request, which means that the payload has to be sent in chunks smaller than 8000 characters (URL size limitation). Small payloads and the use of exe-small is recommended, as you can only do between 10 and 20 injections before using up all the available ManagedConnections until the next server restart. This vulnerability exists in all versions released since 2006, however builds below DC v7 70200 and PMP v6 6500 do not ship with a JSP compiler. You can still try your luck using the MySQL targets as a JDK might be installed in the $PATH.",

The second is a cmdi flaw using the timezone parameter in the admin_sys_time.cgi interface (CVE-2016-7547). Note: You have the option to use the authentication bypass or not since it requires that the server is rebooted. The password reset will render the authentication useless. Typically, if an administrator cant login, they will bounce the box. Therefore, this module performs a heartbeat request until the box is bounced and then attempts to login and to perform the command injection.

It starts by querying the Admin server for the available applications, picks one, and then exploits it. You can also provide an application name to bypass this step, and exploit the application directly. The configuration overwrite is used to change an application server authentication method to \"CAM\", a proprietary IBM auth method, which is simulated by the exploit. The exploit then performs a fake authentication as admin, and finally abuses TM1 scripting to perform a command injection as root or SYSTEM. Testing was done on IBM PA 2.0.6 and IBM TM1 10.2.2 on Windows and Linux. Versions up to and including PA 2.0.8 are vulnerable. It is likely that versions earlier than TM1 10.2.2 are also vulnerable (10.2.2 was released in 2014).",

        "description": "This module exploits a heap buffer overflow within versions of Exim prior to version 4.69. By sending a specially crafted message, an attacker can corrupt the heap and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Exim daemon. The root cause is that no check is made to ensure that the buffer is not full prior to handling '%s' format specifiers within the 'string_vformat' function. In order to trigger this issue, we get our message rejected by sending a message that is too large. This will call into log_write to log rejection headers (which is a default configuration setting). After filling the buffer, a long header string is sent. In a successful attempt, it overwrites the ACL for the 'MAIL FROM' command. By sending a second message, the string we sent will be evaluated with 'expand_string' and arbitrary shell commands can be executed. It is likely that this issue could also be exploited using other techniques such as targeting in-band heap management structures, or perhaps even function pointers stored in the heap. However, these techniques would likely be far more platform specific, more complicated, and less reliable. This bug was original found and reported in December 2008, but was not properly handled as a security issue. Therefore, there was a 2 year lag time between when the issue was fixed and when it was discovered being exploited in the wild. At that point, the issue was assigned a CVE and began being addressed by downstream vendors. An additional vulnerability, CVE-2010-4345, was also used in the attack that led to the discovery of danger of this bug. This bug allows a local user to gain root privileges from the Exim user account. If the Perl interpreter is found on the remote system, this module will automatically exploit the secondary bug as well to get root.",

NetConfig is the Aerohive/Extreme Networks HiveOS administrative webinterface. Vulnerable versions allow for LFI because they rely on a version of PHP 5 that is vulnerable to string truncation attacks. This module leverages this issue in conjunction with log poisoning to gain RCE as root. Upon successful exploitation, the Aerohive NetConfig application may hang for as long as the spawned shell remains open. For the Linux target, the MeterpreterTryToFork option (enabled by default) will likely prevent this. If the app hangs, closing the session should render it responsive again. The module provides an automatic cleanup option to clean the log. However, this option is disabled by default because any modifications to the /tmp/messages log, even via sed, may render the target (temporarily) unexploitable. This state can last over an hour. This module has been successfully tested against Aerohive NetConfig versions 8.2r4 and 10.0r7a.",

The exploit uses the Upload Theme functionality to upload a zip file containing the payload. The plugin uses the admin_init hook, which is also executed for unauthenticated users when accessing a specific URL. The first fix for this vulnerability appeared in version 2.6.7, but the fix can be bypassed. In PHP's default configuration, a POST variable overwrites a GET variable in the $_REQUEST array. The plugin uses $_REQUEST to check for access rights. By setting the POST parameter to something not beginning with 'wysija_', the check is bypassed. Wordpress uses the $_GET array to determine the page, so it is not affected by this. The developers applied the fixes to all previous versions too.",

By sending a specially crafted FTP PORT command, an attacker can corrupt stack memory and execute arbitrary code. This particular issue is caused by processing data bound by attacker controlled input while writing into a 4 byte stack buffer. Unfortunately, the writing that occurs is not a simple byte copy. Processing is done using a source ptr (p) and a destination pointer (q). The vulnerable function walks the input string and continues while the source byte is non-null. If a comma is encountered, the function increments the destination pointer. If an ascii digit [0-9] is encountered, the following occurs: *q = (*q * 10) + (*p - '0'); All other input characters are ignored in this loop. As a consequence, an attacker must craft input such that modifications to the current values on the stack result in usable values. In this exploit, the low two bytes of the return address are adjusted to point at the location of a 'call edi' instruction within the binary. This was chosen since 'edi' points at the source buffer when the function returns. NOTE: This server can be installed as a service using \"vftpd.exe install\". If so, the service does not restart automatically, giving an attacker only one attempt.",

By specifying a long 'arg' parameter when executing the 'jovgraph.exe' CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerable code is within the option parsing function within \"ovwebsnmpsrv.exe\" with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. Reaching the vulnerable code requires a 'POST' request with an 'arg' parameter that, when combined with some static text, exceeds 10240 bytes. The parameter must begin with a dash. It is important to note that this vulnerability must be exploited by overwriting SEH. This is since overflowing the buffer with controllable data always triggers an access violation when attempting to write static text beyond the end of the stack. Exploiting this issue is a bit tricky due to a restrictive character set. In order to accomplish arbitrary code execution, a double-backward jump is used in combination with the Alpha2 encoder.",

On win32 this happens to overwrite the saved instruction pointer, and on linux (depending on compiler, etc) this seems to generally overwrite nothing crucial (read not exploitable). This exploit uses ExitThread(), this will leave icecast thinking the thread is still in use, and the thread counter won't be decremented. This means for each time your payload exits, the counter will be left incremented, and eventually the threadpool limit will be maxed. So you can multihit, but only till you fill the threadpool.",

        "description": "This module exploits the \"custom script\" feature of ADSelfService Plus. The feature was removed in build 6122 as part of the patch for CVE-2022-28810. For purposes of this module, a \"custom script\" is arbitrary operating system command execution. This module uses an attacker provided \"admin\" account to insert the malicious payload into the custom script fields. When a user resets their password or unlocks their account, the payload in the custom script will be executed. The payload will be executed as SYSTEM if ADSelfService Plus is installed as a service, which we believe is the normal operational behavior. This is a passive module because user interaction is required to trigger the payload. This module also does not automatically remove the malicious code from the remote target. Use the \"TARGET_RESET\" operation to remove the malicious custom script when you are done. ADSelfService Plus uses default credentials of \"admin\":\"admin\"",

Versions 7.2.6 and earlier and 9.0 and later are not affected. The vulnerability occurs due to Report.ashx's handler, located in Sitecore.Xdb.Client.dll under the Sitecore.sitecore.shell.ClientBin.Reporting.Report defintion, having a ProcessRequest() handler that calls ProcessReport() with the context of the attacker's request without properly checking if the attacker is authenticated or not. This request then causes ReportDataSerializer.DeserializeQuery() to be called, which will end up calling the DeserializeParameters() function of Sitecore.Analytics.Reporting.ReportDataSerializer, if a \"parameters\" XML tag is found in the attacker's request. Then for each subelement named \"parameter\", the code will check that it has a name and if it does, it will call NetDataContractSerializer().ReadObject on it. NetDataContractSerializer is vulnerable to deserialization attacks and can be trivially exploited by using the TypeConfuseDelegate gadget chain. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain arbitrary code execution as the user that IIS is running as, aka NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE. Users can then use technique 4 of the \"getsystem\" command to use RPCSS impersonation and get SYSTEM level code execution.",

It is also necessary to know the version of Telerik UI ASP.NET that is running. This version number is in the format YYYY.#(.###)? where YYYY is the year of the release (e.g. '2020.3.915').",

Microsoft patched this vulnerability in SP3 for 2005 without any public mention. An authenticated database session is required to access the vulnerable code. That said, it is possible to access the vulnerable code via an SQL injection vulnerability. This exploit smashes several pointers, as shown below. 1. pointer to a 32-bit value that is set to 0 2. pointer to a 32-bit value that is set to a length influenced by the buffer length. 3. pointer to a 32-bit value that is used as a vtable pointer. In MSSQL 2000, this value is referenced with a displacement of 0x38. For MSSQL 2005, the displacement is 0x10. The address of our buffer is conveniently stored in ecx when this instruction is executed. 4. On MSSQL 2005, an additional vtable ptr is smashed, which is referenced with a displacement of 4. This pointer is not used by this exploit. This particular exploit replaces the previous dual-method exploit. It uses a technique where the value contained in ecx becomes the stack. From there, return oriented programming is used to normalize the execution state and finally execute the payload via a \"jmp esp\". All addresses used were found within the sqlservr.exe memory space, yielding very reliable code execution using only a single query. NOTE: The MSSQL server service does not automatically restart by default. That said, some exceptions are caught and will not result in terminating the process.

Successful exploitation should not crash either the service or the server; however, after initial use the port cannot be reused for successive exploitation until the service has been restarted. Consider using a command execution payload following the bind shell to restart the service if you need to reuse the same port. The overflow appears to occur in the debugging/error reporting section of the slmail.exe executable, and there are multiple offsets that will lead to successful exploitation. This exploit uses 2606, the offset that creates the smallest overall payload. The other offset is 4654. The return address is overwritten with a \"jmp esp\" call from the application library SLMFC.DLL found in %SYSTEM%\\system32\\. This return address works against all version of Windows and service packs. The last modification date on the library is dated 06/02/99. Assuming that the code where the overflow occurs has not changed in some time, prior version of SLMail may also be vulnerable with this exploit. The author has not been able to acquire older versions of SLMail for testing purposes. Please let us know if you were able to get this exploit working against other SLMail versions.",
